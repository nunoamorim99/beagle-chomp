# CLAUDE.md — Beagle Chomp

A responsive, installable (PWA) maze-chase game built with **three.js + TypeScript + Vite**.
Guide a beagle around a maze, eat every biscuit to clear the map, chomp a bone to turn
the ghosts scared and edible. This file is the source of truth for how we build it.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — start the dev server (Vite)
- `npm run editor` — dev server + open the **character editor** (`/editor/`, dev-only page)
- `npm run build` — typecheck + production build
- `npm run test` — **run the headless logic tests** (maze validation + gameplay sim)
- `npm run validate` / `npm run sim` — the two tests individually

**Rule: after any change to `src/game/{grid,movement,ghostAI}.ts` or the maze data,
run `npm run test` and make it pass before you consider the task done.** These tests are
the safety net for the trickiest logic and run without a browser.

## Tech & conventions
- TypeScript **strict**. No `any` without a written reason.
- Keep **pure game logic** (`src/game/*`) free of any `three` import, so it stays
  unit-testable in Node. Only `src/render/*`, `src/editor/*` (the dev-only character
  editor — never in the production build) and `src/main.ts` may import three.
- One responsibility per module. Compose the proven modules; don't reinvent them.
- No `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` assumptions for core state — keep state in memory.
- Balance numbers live in `src/game/config.ts`. Don't scatter magic numbers.

## What is BUILT (do not rewrite lightly)
The full game is built, shipped, and deployed (playable since v1.0; **now on v6.0 "The Long Walk"**).

**v5.0 made this a full-stack app.** It is no longer a static offline PWA:
- **Frontend** — `beaglechomp.nunoamorim.dev` (Cloudflare Pages). Needs `VITE_API_URL` at build time.
- **API** — `beaglechomp-api.nunoamorim.dev`, source in `server/` (Hono + Postgres + argon2id,
  deployed by Dokploy from this same repo — see `server/README.md` and root `STACK.md`).
- **Sign-in is required before play.** `src/main.ts` awaits the auth gate before `new Game()` exists;
  there is no guest mode. `profileStore.ts` kept all 19 synchronous signatures but now reads an
  in-memory cache hydrated from the server, so `game.ts`/`shop.ts`/`levelMap.ts` were untouched.
- **Scores are server-validated** (`server/src/validation/plausibility.ts`, pure + heavily tested).
  Its constants are GENERATED from the real game modules by `server/scripts/sync-game-constants.ts`
  — so **after changing `config.ts`, `mazes.json` or `challenges.ts`, run `npm run sync` in
  `server/`**, or honest runs will start being rejected. `npm run test:catalog` fails on drift.
- **The API measures itself** (IDEA-039): every request is timed by the outermost middleware and a
  p95-per-route table goes to the container log every 10 minutes, with `GET /metrics` for the JSON
  form (only exists when `METRICS_TOKEN` is set). Route labels are Hono's matched PATTERN, never
  the raw path — see `server/src/http/metrics.ts` and `server/README.md` § Observability. The
  `[slow-query]` line at 200 ms is deliberately STACK.md §6's own Redis trigger, so **Redis stays
  deferred until that line actually appears, or a second replica exists** — not on a hunch.
- **Pure logic** (`src/game/*`): `mazes.json`+`mazes.ts` (two **validated** mazes —
  connected, all pellets reachable, ghosts can leave the pen), `grid.ts` (tiles, tunnel
  wrap, walkability), `movement.ts` (tile-stepping model), `ghostAI.ts` (targeting with a
  dead-end-safe fallback), `state.ts` + `game.ts` (loop + state machine, the integration point).
- **Render layer** (`src/render/*`): `scene.ts`, `board.ts`, `characters.ts`,
  `effects.ts`, plus `toon.ts` — the shared 3-step cel ramp.
- **The whole scene is CEL-SHADED** (IDEA-024 v2): every lit surface is a
  `MeshToonMaterial` on the one gradient from `src/render/toon.ts`, and the
  renderer runs with `NoToneMapping` — a filmic curve re-compresses the ramp's
  bands and undoes the point of it. Build materials with `toon({...})`, never
  `new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial`; `roughness`/`metalness` do not exist on a
  toon material. The eye glint is the one deliberate exception: it is
  `MeshBasicMaterial` (unlit), because a toon ramp quantises a highlight into
  the same band as everything else facing the light and it stops reading as a
  catchlight.
- **The character editor knows about it**: `isEditableMaterial` accepts every
  model its new `shading` dropdown can produce (toon/standard/phong/lambert/
  basic), and controls for channels a given model lacks — `roughness`,
  `emissive` — are omitted rather than shown wired to nothing (IDEA-041's rule).
- **`preview/index.html`** — a dev-only page at `/preview/` (`npm run dev`) that
  renders the real `makeBeagle()` with orbit controls, six preset camera angles
  (`?view=`) and part isolation (`?solo=`). Not a rollup input, so it never
  ships (same construction as `/editor/`).
- **Input / UI / PWA**: `src/input/{touch,keyboard}.ts`, `src/ui/{hud,sound,install}.ts`,
  `public/icons/*` (192, 512, 512-maskable).
- **Wall surfaces are PROCEDURAL** (`src/render/wallTexture.ts`): each theme's
  palette carries a `wallTexture` kind — `hedge` (garden/forest/park), `sand`
  (beach), `brick` (city), `flat` (arcade) — drawn to a 128px canvas at runtime,
  never loaded. Three rules they follow: generated not shipped (this is a PWA
  with no texture assets), luminance-only averaging near white (the map
  MULTIPLIES `palette.wall`, so a grey texture would darken every theme), and
  seamless (walls are one InstancedMesh of unit boxes, so each tile shows the
  full 0..1 — a non-tiling pattern turns the maze into a grid of stamps).
  Swapping the map needs `material.needsUpdate` — null↔texture changes the
  shader program.
- **Floor surfaces are PROCEDURAL AND GRID-DERIVED** (`src/render/floorTexture.ts`):
  `floorTexture` kinds `stone`/`earth`/`sand`/`parkGrass`/`road`/`flat`. The floor
  is one `PlaneGeometry(COLS+2, ROWS+2)` with plain 0..1 UVs, so tile `(tx,ty)`
  maps to canvas `((tx+1.5)*S, (ty+1.5)*S)` and the maze itself can be painted in
  — that's how the garden's stepping stones, the park's gravel walk and the road
  markings follow the corridors. `S = 32`, and every pattern is written in terms
  of `K = S/16` (sizes scale with K, scatter counts with K²) so the resolution
  can move without restyling the five surfaces. Two rules differ from the walls,
  both load-bearing:
  1. **They carry COLOUR.** A `map` multiplies, so the brightest thing a
     luminance map can make is the material's own colour — on Night City's
     `0x3a3640` floor a `grey(1)` lane marking still rendered at 0.22 and was
     invisible. So the texture bakes `palette.floor` in as its ground and
     `board.ts` holds `matFloor.color` at **white**. Don't tint it twice.
  2. **The map also drives `emissiveMap`.** Floor palettes add a flat emissive
     lift *after* the multiply, which swamped the pattern on the dark themes.
  Grid-derived means **not cached** (a cache keyed by kind would paint level 1's
  corridors into level 2's floor) — `syncBoardMaterials` disposes the outgoing one.
- **Character editor tabs** (`/editor/`, dev-only): **Character** (characters.ts),
  **Pickups** (the maze items in board.ts — power bone, bonus-life bone, fruit,
  coin), **Board & Themes**, **Props**. Character and Pickups are the SAME
  machinery over a different registry and source file: part tree, inspector,
  generated code, real-source panel and save-in-place all read `sourceFile`
  off the def rather than assuming one file. Adding a mesh tab means adding a
  registry entry — not a parallel copy of the editor.
- **Tests**: `scripts/validate-maze.ts`, `scripts/sim-logic.ts` — import the real modules.
  `scripts/test-board-surfaces.ts` guards the one silent failure in the theme pipeline:
  **`src/editor/boardCodegen.ts` writes a palette field by field, by hand**, so a new
  `ThemePalette` key that the writer doesn't know about is quietly dropped from every
  theme saved in the editor. Add a palette field → add it to the writer.
- **Character editor** (`editor/index.html` + `src/editor/*`): dev-only workbench at
  `/editor/` — tweak the real character meshes live, add parts, copy the generated
  three.js code into `characters.ts`. Not a rollup input, so it never ships (see
  vite.config.ts note + docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- `prototype/beagle-chomp.html` — a fully working single-file version. Now a **historical
  reference artifact** (render/loop/HUD are shipped), not a to-build spec.

## What is next
No stubs remain. Current and future work is tracked in the **Idea-Ledger**
(`Idea-Ledger/Backlog.md` + `VersionControl.md`) — the source of truth for what we build
and ship next.

## Architecture (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for detail)
- **Coordinate system:** grid tile `(tx,ty)` → world `((tx-OX)*TILE, y, (ty-OZ)*TILE)`.
  `up = -Z`, `down = +Z`, `left = -X`, `right = +X`.
- **Entity model:** everything moves on the tile grid via `stepEntity`; renderers read
  `entityWorld(e)` each frame and never mutate logic.
- **Game loop:** fixed-ish update → sync meshes → render. State machine:
  `ready → play → (dying | levelclear) → …`.

## The team of agents (see .claude/agents/)
- **game-architect** — module boundaries, integration reviews, keeps docs current.
- **gameplay-engineer** — movement, AI, state machine, scoring, collisions, input.
- **render-artist** — three.js scene, meshes, materials, lighting, camera, animation.
- **pwa-mobile-engineer** — PWA/offline/install, responsive canvas, touch controls.
- **qa-test-engineer** — headless tests, regression sims, playtest checklists.
- **level-designer** — authoring + validating new mazes.

Delegate the matching slice to the matching agent. Keep pure logic and render layers
decoupled so agents can work in parallel.
